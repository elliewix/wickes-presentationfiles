PHP is one of the most commonly used langauges for dynamic websites was created by Rasmus Lerdorf for his own website and projects.  Having satisfied a need niche, others began asking to use the tool as well and adoption  grew to include even commercial enterprises.  However, because it was originally created as a personal project, there were little to no standards in place, and the language suffers from it's disorganized origins.\n",
      "\n",
      "While most languages can be adapted to nearly any type of prgammatic task, there are usually tasks that it has been optimized for.  For example, PHP is framed to deal with websites and connections to databases.  While it can be used for text processing purposes, it isn't exactly optimal or easy to do complex text processing tasks with it.  Python, however, has been extended with packages to be a powerful web language, but is highly optimized for working as a basic scripting language and includes excellent build in data and text processing tools.  Java, for example, lacks built in CSV reader libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Style\n",
      "\n",
      "We call programming languages \"languages\" because they are exactly that.  Each has a formal syntax for expressing actions and statements.  As I mentioned before, most commonly used programming languages are based around English.  However, this doesn't mean you should expect all of the vocabulary in those languages to make logical connections to English use.  Keywords will generally appear English-like or be real English words, but may be used in strange ways from what you expected.  Keep an open mind and put on your 'language learning hat' while going through this workshop.\n",

Python has an advantage in this that it really only deals with two, because it handles a lot of the nuances behind the scenes.  So, why do we need ever more than one?\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of this has to do with legacy computing and how computers store memory.  Very simply put, storing some kinds of numbers takes up less space than others.  When memory was super expensive, allowing a number to take up extra memory space was expensive and took up valuable space.  Thus they optimized the kinds of numbers that were stored.  For example, to cover all possible numbers we would need to allocate at least 64 units of space.  But 99% of the numbers that were used only need something like 16 units to be stored.  Thus, there are up to 48 units being used for the majority of those numbers.  So, when we can express numbers in different groups, we can optimize how they are stored and allow the programmers to control how much space is needed to store them.\n",
